### WORKSHOP DETAILS

In this workshop, participants will learn to perform  (2D/3D)  data visualization using Python 3 along with Paraview. Participants will have an opportunity to familiarise themselves with a subset of the data they will work with during the Data Visualisation competition, and perform a series of exercises to visualise it.
